# Checkpoint: Save & Restore Task State

Manage checkpoints for long-running tasks. Enables recovery from interruptions and context window exhaustion.

## Subcommands

### save [label]

Save current state with an optional label.

```bash
bun ~/.claude/src/scripts/checkpoint.ts save "Completed phase 3 migration"
```

### list

List all checkpoints for the current project.

```bash
bun ~/.claude/src/scripts/checkpoint.ts list
```

### show [checkpoint-id]

Show details of a specific checkpoint.

```bash
bun ~/.claude/src/scripts/checkpoint.ts show chk-20240115-103000
```

### restore [checkpoint-id]

Restore from the latest checkpoint, or a specific one by ID.

```bash
# Restore latest
bun ~/.claude/src/scripts/checkpoint.ts restore

# Restore specific
bun ~/.claude/src/scripts/checkpoint.ts restore chk-20240115-103000
```

### clean

Remove old checkpoints, keeping the last 10.

```bash
bun ~/.claude/src/scripts/checkpoint.ts clean
```

## Examples

```
User: "save a checkpoint"
  -> /checkpoint save

User: "checkpoint before this refactor"
  -> /checkpoint save "Before auth refactor"

User: "list my checkpoints"
  -> /checkpoint list

User: "restore from last checkpoint"
  -> /checkpoint restore

User: "show checkpoint details"
  -> /checkpoint show <id>

User: "clean up old checkpoints"
  -> /checkpoint clean
```

## Storage

Checkpoints are stored at `~/.claude/checkpoints/<project-name>/` as JSON files with a `latest` symlink pointing to the most recent.
